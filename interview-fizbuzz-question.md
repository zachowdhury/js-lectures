### Interview question 
When it comes to "interview test" questions, the subject of FizzBuzz often comes up, like write a function;
- which populates integer 1 to 100 , [you could generate an Array programatically]
where condition:
- if number divisible by 3 will print "fizz" 
- if number divisible by 5 will print "buzz"
- if number divisible by both 3 and 5 will printout "fizzbuzz"

so how to approach that vision.

```sh
const myFiller = Array
  .from(new Array(100).keys(),n => n+1)
  .map((elem, itm, arr)=>{
    var f = elem % 3 == 0, b = elem % 5 == 0;
    return (f ? b ? "fizzbuzz" : "fizz" : b ? "buzz" : elem);
  }
).map(elem => console.log ( elem ))

```
